This project was created during a Database system class. This project is about Bears in Canada and design and implementing a database for research done on the Bears. The database is based off of the physical data model (PDM) and logical data model (LDM) created. The database uses a 5NF normalization form. The database was designed around the information provided in the memos. After creating the PDM and LDM the database was created and using insert statements to fill the database with the information in the memos.
